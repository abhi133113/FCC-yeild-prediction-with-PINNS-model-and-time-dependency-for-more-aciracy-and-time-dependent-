# FCC-yeild-prediction-with-PINNS-model-and-time-dependency-for-more-aciracy-and-time-dependent-
This project predicts FCC process yield using Catalyst to Oil Ratio, Feed Rate, and Temperature parameters. It explores time dependency and compares Random Forest, ANN, and Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) to enhance prediction accuracy.
